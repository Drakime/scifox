## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. In the searchbar type `about:config`. A dialog will be shown to you. Press the **I accept the risk** button.
2. Search for **`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`**, **`layers.acceleration.force-enabled`**, **`gfx.webrender.all`**, and **`svg.context-properties.content.enabled`**. Change them to **True**
3. Go to your Firefox profile:
    - If you're on Linux: `$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXX.default-release/`
    - If you're on Windows: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXX`
    - If you're on MacOS: `Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXXX`
4. Move the `chrome` folder into the directory.
5. Install the [sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/) addon and go to `sidebery settings > Help > Import addon data` then pick `sidebery.json` and apply everything.
6. Make all the customizations you want.
7. Enjoy!

> I am using [FantasqueSansM Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) in this configuration as a preferred font (you might want to download it) but you can change it easily in the 'FONTS' section in `userChrome` and `userContent` css files.

## üöÄ Usage

This userstyle has a keyboard centered usage:

-   `Alt` You can access to the global menu for an extended options you need
-   `Alt + Left Arrow` You can go Back
-   `Alt + Right Arrow` You can go Forward
-   `Ctrl + L` focuses the Navbar
-   `Ctrl + T` Opens a new Tab
-   `Ctrl + W` Closes a Tab
-   `Ctrl + Shift + T` Re-opens a tab that you just closed
-   `Ctrl + R` Refresh the page you're on
-   `Ctrl + Shift + A` Quick open for Add-Ons

### üîß Recommended settings

- Right click on toolbar -> Customize.
- Remove and Organize (as you want) all the removable elements including extensions, drag space and buttons.
- Install the [Adaptive Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/) add on for a cleaner UI.

### Tips

- In `about:config` set `browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.improvesearch.handoffToAwesomebar` to false to use the homepage search bar without jumping to the url bar.
- In `Settings > Search > Search Shortcuts` untick everything to get a minimal look in search suggestions.
